============

In order to work, UI prototype requires internet connection and will probably crash if not available.
You can change properties that simulate overall system state here: http://adii.hci.jit.su/

Note that web page doesn't read the actual state from backend so you have to toggle checkboxes once to make backend
in sync with what you see.

Dropbox mockup is there to illustrate intended interaction between cloud apps and our app. It was used in test scenarios.
